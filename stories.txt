\cf0 There is always a negative aspect that will overshadow a positive craving\
"There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night."\
To me, this meant that there is always a negative aspect attached to something positive, and for that negative aspect, it is important to know its consequences. Applying this to Sisyphus's situation, he desired the positive aspect of happiness, and therefore he remained in the world above; this caused him happiness, but the negative aspect is that if he would get caught, he would face serious punishment. This clearly happened and resulted in futile and hopeless labor.\
"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."\

Vice Versa: with negative situations, there is also a positive aspect. This is concluded in the end when Camus explains that Sisyphus's act of rolling the rock uphill is an act of concluding that all is well, negating the gods. He uses this torment, this negative situation, and uses it to create a positive situation from, to prove the gods' punishment as ineffective by showing that it doesn't get to him, he's strong enough to mentally stay sane.\
